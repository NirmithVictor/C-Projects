In this I have 

ğŸ‘‰ Currency Converter although the currency change are totally incorrect and it just is a simple user input, switch and a little bit of exception handling (beginner level)

ğŸ‘‰ I have created a chip game as per the required linkedIn Course challanges needed me to,  So I used a struct and linkedList/ random numbers / user's input / which will then be lead straight to a continous loop with AI or another player till user wins and using loops we will be able to see if the user's want to play again and winners history and number of rounds will be written into a file ğŸ˜‰
